					Evil Geniuses (EG) is an eSports organization based in San Francisco, California, United States. Founded in 1999 by Alexander Garfield, the organization fields players in various fighting games, Dota 2, League of Legends, StarCraft II, World of Warcraft, and Halo. Evil Geniuses was also considered as one of the best Quake clans in the late 90s.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainText">
					It is a subsidiary of GoodGame Agency, which in turn is owned by Amazon.com Inc. through its division Twitch. GoodGame Agency also owns Alliance, a similar eSports team for primarily European teams.
				</p>
				<p class="mainText">
					The Evil Geniuses Dota 2 squad won The International 2015, receiving the single largest prize payout in esports history.

				<p class="mainText">
					The Evil Geniuses DotA team represents some the most formidable talent in the Western scene and has proven themselves amongst the best in the world. EG continually adds to a lengthy list of accomplishments that include 1st place finishes at the AVerMedia Cup, EiZo Cup, DotaCinema Roshan Pit, and 2nd place finishes at the DreamHack Winter 2012, RaidCall EMS One, American Dota League, D2L Season One, and 3rd at The Defense, The Defense 4, The Premier League 5, and DreamHack Summer 2012 and 2013.

					<span class="label">UNiVeRsE</span>
					Saahil "UNiVeRsE" Arora is a decorated DotA veteran, having competed in all four of Valve's yearly Dota 2 championships, The International. UNiVeRsE has become a fixture in the North American DotA scene as one of the most talented offlaners the West has to offer, able to deliver high-impact plays without overextending.

				<p class="mainText">
					<span class="label">Fear</span>
					Clinton “Fear” Loomis combines a terrifying mix of raw talent and honed experience to dominate in any situation, his versatility making him one of the fiercest competitors in the world. Widely known (and respected) as "Old Man DotA," Fear has had near unrivaled presence in the competitive scene since 2006.

					<span class="label">ppd</span>
					Originally a HoN player, Peter “ppd” Dager burst onto the Dota 2 scene in 2014 as the new Captain of EG. Despite playing an extremely gold-starved style of support, ppd never fails to make his presence felt through his in-game leadership and carefully calculated drafting.

				<p class = "mainText">
					<span class="label">Suma1L</span>
					Sumail "Suma1L" Hassan Syed shocked the DotA world in 2015 when, at the young age of 15 and playing his second ever LAN event, he helped EG capture a $1,200,000 title by leading the team to 1st place at the Dota Asia Championships.
				</p>

				<p class = "mainText">
					<span class="label">zai</span>
					Breaking into the eSports scene through Heroes of Newerth, Ludwig “zai” Wåhlberg has rapidly become a force to be reckoned with in Dota 2. Don’t mistake his age for anything other than a fresh mind for the meta game and an eagerness to prove himself, or you’ll be sorely disappointed.
