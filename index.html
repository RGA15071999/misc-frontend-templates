					Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a mod for the 2002 video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011, and is one of the most actively played games on Steam, with peaks of over a million concurrent players.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainText">
					Dota 2 is played in matches between two five-player teams, each of which occupies a base in a corner of the playing field. Each player controls one of 111 playable characters, called "heroes", that feature unique abilities and styles of play. During a match, the player collects gold, items, and experience points for their hero, while fighting heroes of the opposite team. A team wins by destroying the other side's "Ancient" building, located within the opposing base.

					Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve for the same role. Upon release, Dota 2 was praised by critics for its gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, despite being criticized for its steep learning curve. Dota 2 initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported over to Source 2 in September 2015, making it the first game to use it. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and cosmetics for the heroes, which are then uploaded to the Steam Workshop. The popularity of Dota 2 has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, toys, and promotional tie-ins to other games and media.

					Dota 2 has a widespread and active eSports scene, with teams from across the world playing in various leagues and tournaments. Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of dollars, the highest of any eSport. The largest of them is known as The International, which is hosted by Valve and takes place annually at the KeyArena in Seattle. Starting in 2015, Valve also began sponsoring smaller, but seasonally held tournaments known as the Majors, the first of which was held in Frankfurt, Germany. Dedicated media coverage of professional tournaments are broadcast live on the internet, and sometimes on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions.

					The International (TI) is an annual Dota 2 eSports tournament hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer. Sixteen teams are given invitations to compete in the tournament. The first tournament took place in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom from August 17–21, 2011 and was held shortly after the reveal of Dota 2, with a total prize pot of $1.6 million and a grand prize of one million dollars. The second International took place from August 31–September 2, 2012 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington and retained the same $1.6 million prize structure. For the third International, again at Benaroya Hall, Valve introduced an interactive, digital "compendium" which fans could purchase to follow the event and contribute to the prize pool; TI3 spanned August 7–11, 2013 and reached a $2.8 million prize pool with $1.2 million added from compendium purchases. The fourth International, this time held at the larger Seattle venue KeyArena from July 18–21, 2014 and continued the practice of compendium sales and ultimately broke records for having the largest prize pool in eSports history, with a total of $10.9 million.

					The fifth International took place on August 3–8, 2015, also at KeyArena. The prize pool totaled over $18 million, making it the largest eSports prize pool to date for a single tournament. <a href = "additional.html" class="link" target="_blank">Evil Geniuses</a> were the champions and took 36% of the prize pool($6,634,661)	 
				</p>

				<p class="mainText">
					The International 2016 is the sixth annual edition of The International. The tournament will be hosted in Seattle for the fifth consecutive year; it is the third consecutive year that the Main Event takes place at KeyArena, a multi-purpose arena in Seattle Center with a total seating capacity of over 17,000. Main Event will be held from August 8th to August 13th in Key Arena, Seattle, Washington. The current total prize pool is $18,184,381 ($16,584,381 added), and it is still growing. 
				</p>

				<p class = "mainText">
					Six teams were directly invited to the event, with eight regional winners and two winners from the wild card bracket also participating. The International 2015 champion, Evil Geniuses, did not receive a direct invite to the International due to breaking Valve's rules on roster swapping prior to the tournament. They and Team Secret, who also broke the same rule, were forced to make their way through the open and main qualifiers, eventually finishing first in their respective regions, gaining an invite.
